[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is a Kubernetes add-on for automatically managing DNS records for Kubernetes ingresses and services by using different DNS providers. This webhook provider allows you to automate DNS records from your Kubernetes clusters into your MikroTik router.

Supported DNS record types: `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`, `SRV`, `TXT`

For examples of creating DNS records either via CRDs or via Ingress/Service annotations, check out the [`example/` directory](./example/).

## üéØ Requirements

- ExternalDNS >= `v0.15.0`

> [!Note]
> `v0.15.0` of ExternalDNS added support for `providerSpecific` annotations in Ingress/Service objects for webhook providers.
>
> While older versions of ExternalDNS may work, support for this feature will not be present.

- Mikrotik RouterOS (tested on `7.16` stable)

> [!Note]
> While other versions of RouterOS **might** work, they have not been officially tested. If you are using this webhook successfully with a different ROS version, feel free to post a comment in mirceanton/external-dns-provider-mikrotik#141
>
> Thus far, we know for sure `7.16` works and `7.12` does not.

## üö´ Limitations

### Regexp Records

While the webhook can read records with a regexp defined, external-dns itself cannot manage them. This means that they either need to be excluded via `domainFilters` or `excludeDomains` so that external-dns will not try to assume ownership over them.

The problem is that from Mikrotiks perspective, a DNS record can **either** have a `name` or a `regexp`. They are mutually exclusive.

This is problematic because, even though we can create an `Endpoint` with no name, external-dns will try to create a TXT record to keep track of the ownership over said record. If the main record has no name, it errors out creating the TXT record too, since the TXT record name is based on the name of the main record.

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Create a service account in RouterOS. This local user needs read and write access to manage static DNS.
2. Create a Kubernetes namespace for your External DNS deployment

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: external-dns
    ```

3. Create a Kubernetes secret with the connection details for your RouterOS instance:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mikrotik-credentials
      namespace: external-dns
    stringData:
      MIKROTIK_BASEURL: "https://192.168.88.1:443"
      MIKROTIK_USERNAME: "external-dns"
      MIKROTIK_PASSWORD: "external-dns"
      MIKROTIK_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY: "true"
    ```

4. Add the External DNS helm repository and update your local cache

    ```bash
    helm repo add external-dns https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/
    helm repo update
    ```

5. Configure your helm values. Take a look at the [example values.yaml](./example/values.yaml)
6. Install the External DNS helm chart

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install --namespace external-dns external-dns external-dns/external-dns -f values.yaml
    ```

> [!TIP]
> By default, support for MX, NS and SRV records is disabled and needs to be enabled via the `--managed-record-types` argument.
> Make sure to set `--managed-record-types=SRV` if you want to enable SRV records, and so on.
